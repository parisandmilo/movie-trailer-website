# Diana's Movie Trailer Website
First Udacity project for the Full-Stack Nanodegree

## What?

Python writes server-side code to store a list of favorite movies, including box art imagery, movie information and a trailer on-click. 

This data is then generated as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

## Running the Program
Run `entertainment_centre.py` to generate the HTML page

## Updating
Update content in the `entertainment_centre.py` file, this function is constructed in `media.py`
